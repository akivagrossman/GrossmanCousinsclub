    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      At Grossman Cousins Club, we take privacy about as seriously as Uncle Ron takes
      karaoke night — not very, but with a lot of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's what we collect:
      <ul>
        <li>Your name (so we know who beat us at dreidel)</li>
        <li>Your cousin facts (because trivia night gets competitive)</li>
        <li>Whatever you type into the chat (you better believe we’re watching 👀)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will never sell your data, mostly because we don’t even know how to do that.
      Your secrets are safe with us — until next Passover, when they’ll be brought up at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using this site, you agree to everything above and also to let Aunt Miriam kiss you on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>Stay goofy. Stay Grossman. Stay private-ish.</p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">❤️ - Your loving (and nosy) cousins</p>
